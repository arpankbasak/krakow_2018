## goals

- appreciation for statistical rules  
(practical rigor, not methodological rigor)
- ways to think about/look at data
- familiarity with statistical techniques
- landscape of more advanced techniques

## ground rules

- no "stupid" questions
- too basic:
    - ask! I can help later
    - get what you can 
- too advanced:
    - ask! we can talk later
    - think about pedagogy
- please give feedback as we go along
